<ul>
  <li>the photographs are all available in my instagram page <a href="https://www.instagram.com/abhishekmohite421/?hl=en">here</a>.</li>
  <li>i created the web apps out of interest or got them as course assignment.</li>
  <li>most of the sketches are from my high school time when i drew, then i stopped. Some of them are bad, i know and they are there so that 
    i remember to draw better once to replace them.
